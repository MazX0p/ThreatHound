# Iâ€™ve built the following:
- A dedicated backend to support Sigma rules for python
- A dedicated backend for parsing evtx for python
- A dedicated backend for match between cvs and the Sigma rules
- A dedicated backend to match between evtx and the Sigma rules

# To-do:
[x] ~~Support for Sigma rules dedicated for DNS query~~ 
[x] ~~Modifying the speed of algorithm dedicated for the detection and making it faster~~
[x] ~~Adding csv output that supports SIEMS~~
[x] ~~More features~~

# installiton:
